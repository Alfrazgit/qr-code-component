## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that getting your code to look organized is very important. Makes it easier to find problems and what are the things you need to change in order to achieve what you're after.

### Continued development

I want to learn about responsive websites and try to make them myself. I also hope that I can make exactly what I have in mind and that I can add more creativity in my work.
